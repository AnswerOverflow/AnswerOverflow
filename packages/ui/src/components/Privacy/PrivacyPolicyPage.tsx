				<h2>2. Legal bases for processing</h2>
				<p>
					Hedgehog Software LLC. will collect data lawfully, fairly and in a
					transparent manner. We collect and process information about you only
					where we have legal bases for doing so.
				</p>
				<p>
					These legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them,
					meaning we collect and use your information only where:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						it’s necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a
						party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a
						contract (for example, when we provide a service you request from
						us);
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li>
					it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your
					data protection interests), such as for research and development, to
					market and promote our services, and to protect our legal rights and
					interests;
				</li>
				<li>
					you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose (for example, you
					might consent to us sending you our newsletter); or
				</li>
				<li>we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>

				<p>
					When you consent to our use of information about you for a specific
					purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time (but this
					will not affect any processing that has already taken place).
				</p>

				<p>
					We don’t keep personal information for longer than is necessary. While
					we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially
					acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized
					access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. That said, we advise
					that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure
					and cannot guarantee absolute data security. If necessary, we may
					retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal
					obligation or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital
					interests of another natural person.
				</p>
				<h2>3. Collection and use of information</h2>
				<p>
					We may collect, hold, use and disclose information for the following
					purposes and personal information will not be further processed in a
					manner that is incompatible with these purposes:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>to provide you with our platform{"'"}s core features;</li>
				</ul>
				<li>
					to enable you to access and use our website, associated applications
					and associated social media platforms;
				</li>
				<li>to contact and communicate with you;</li>
				<li>for internal record keeping and administrative purposes;</li>
				<li>
					to run competitions and/or offer additional benefits to you; and
				</li>
				<li>
					to comply with our legal obligations and resolve any disputes that we
					may have.
				</li>
				<h2>4. Disclosure of personal information to third parties</h2>
				<p>We may disclose personal information to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						third party service providers for the purpose of enabling them to
						provide their services, including (without limitation) IT service
						providers, data storage, hosting and server providers, analytics,
						error loggers, maintenance or problem-solving providers,
						professional advisors and payment systems operators;
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li>our employees, contractors and/or related entities; and</li>
				<li>
					courts, tribunals, regulatory authorities and law enforcement
					officers, as required by law, in connection with any actual or
					prospective legal proceedings, or in order to establish, exercise or
					defend our legal rights.
				</li>

				<p>
					If the ownership or control of all or part of Hedgehog Software LLC or
					their assets change, we may transfer your information to the new
					owner.
				</p>

				<h2>5. International transfers of personal information</h2>
				<p>
					The personal information we collect is stored and processed in the
					United States, or where we or our partners, affiliates and third-party
					providers maintain facilities. By providing us with your personal
					information, you consent to the disclosure to these overseas third
					parties.
				</p>

				<p>
					We will ensure that any transfer of personal information from
					countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries outside the
					EEA will be protected by appropriate safeguards, for example by using
					standard data protection clauses approved by the European Commission,
					or the use of binding corporate rules or other legally accepted means.
				</p>

				<p>
					Where we transfer personal information from a non-EEA country to
					another country, you acknowledge that third parties in other
					jurisdictions may not be subject to similar data protection laws to
					the ones in our jurisdiction. There are risks if any such third party
					engages in any act or practice that would contravene the data privacy
					laws in our jurisdiction and this might mean that you will not be able
					to seek redress under our jurisdiction’s privacy laws.
				</p>
				<h2>6. Your rights and controlling your personal information</h2>
				<p>
					Choice and consent: By providing personal information to us, you
					consent to us collecting, holding, using and disclosing your personal
					information in accordance with this privacy policy. If you are under
					16 years of age, you must have, and warrant to the extent permitted by
					law to us, that you have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to
					access and use the website and they (your parents or guardian) have

					not have to provide personal information to us, however, if you do
					not, it may affect your use of this website or the products and/or

				<p>
					Information from third parties: If we receive personal information
					about you from a third party, we will protect it as set out in this
					privacy policy. If you are a third party providing personal
					information about somebody else, you represent and warrant that you
					have such person’s consent to provide the personal information to us.
				</p>

				<p>
					Restrict: You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your
					personal information. If you have previously agreed to us using your
					personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change
					your mind at any time by contacting us using the details below. If you

					we will let you know how the restriction affects your use of our
					website or products and services.

					information that we hold about you. You may request a copy of the
					personal information we hold about you. Where possible, we will
					provide this information. You may request that we erase the personal
					information we hold about you at any time. You may also request that
					we transfer this personal information to another third party.
				</p>

				<p>
					Correction: If you believe that any information we hold about you is
					inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading, please
					contact us using the details below. We will take reasonable steps to

					relation to your complaint.

				<h2>What is a cookie?</h2>
				<p>
					A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device
					when you visit, typically containing information about the website
					itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web
					browser when you return, additional data that serves the purpose of
					the cookie, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.
				</p>

				<p>
					Cookies are used to enable certain features (eg. logging in), to track
					site usage (eg. analytics), to store your user settings (eg. timezone,
					notification preferences), and to personalize your content (eg.
					advertising, language).
				</p>

				<p>
					Cookies set by the website you are visiting are normally referred to
					as “first-party cookies”, and typically only track your activity on
					that particular site. Cookies set by other sites and companies (ie.
					third parties) are called “third-party cookies”, and can be used to
					track you on other websites that use the same third-party service.
				</p>

				<h2>Types of cookies and how we use them</h2>
				<h3>Essential cookies</h3>
				<p>
					Essential cookies are crucial to your experience of a website,
					enabling core features like user logins, account management, shopping
					carts and payment processing. We use essential cookies to enable
					certain functions on our website.
				</p>

				<h3>Performance cookies</h3>
				<p>
					Performance cookies are used in the tracking of how you use a website
					during your visit, without collecting personal information about you.
					Typically, this information is anonymous and aggregated with
					information tracked across all site users, to help companies
					understand visitor usage patterns, identify and diagnose problems or
					errors their users may encounter, and make better strategic decisions
					in improving their audience’s overall website experience. These
					cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by
					third-party services. We use performance cookies on our site.
				</p>

				<h3>Functionality cookies</h3>
				<p>
					Functionality cookies are used in collecting information about your
					device and any settings you may configure on the website you’re
					visiting (like language and time zone settings). With this
					information, websites can provide you with customized, enhanced or
					optimized content and services. These cookies may be set by the
					website you’re visiting (first-party) or by third-party service. We
					use functionality cookies for selected features on our site.
				</p>
				<h2>Third-party cookies on our site</h2>
				<p>
					We may employ third-party companies and individuals on our
					websites—for example, analytics providers and content partners. We
					grant these third parties access to selected information to perform
					specific tasks on our behalf. They may also set third-party cookies in
					order to deliver the services they are providing. Third-party cookies
					can be used to track you on other websites that use the same
					third-party service. As we have no control over third-party cookies,
					they are not covered by AnswerOverflow’s cookie policy.
				</p>

				<h2>How you can control or opt out of cookies</h2>
				<p>
					If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you can instruct your
					browser to refuse cookies from our website. Most browsers are
					configured to accept cookies by default, but you can update these
					settings to either refuse cookies altogether, or to notify you when a
					website is trying to set or update a cookie.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you browse websites from multiple devices, you may need to update
					your settings on each individual device.
				</p>

				<p>
					Although some cookies can be blocked with little impact on your
					experience of a website, blocking all cookies may mean you are unable
					to access certain features and content across the sites you visit.
