			"description": "# Context\nI built an AI Voice Assistant (AI receptionist) on Vapi. Its tasks are to answer calls, help clients with their questions, check availability, and book or manage appointments.\nIt has two tools:\n•    Check Availability: checks available and busy time slots on the calendar.\n•    Create Event: books and manages appointments.\nI integrated the calendar into Vapi through the Integrations tab, which has access to creating and editing events and checking availability.\n\n# Issue\nWhen the agent is asked to check availability, it doesn’t detect busy time slots on the calendar and shows a time slot as “free” even when there is already a booked appointment. The Check Availability tool does not parse the busy time slots. I will paste the response returned by the Check Availability tool when it is asked to check available times below:\n\nResponse Details\n{\n\"busy\": [],\n\"free\": [\n{\n\"start\": \"2025-12-26T14:00:00.000Z\",\n\"end\": \"2025-12-26T15:00:00.000Z\"\n}\n]\n}\n\n# Notes\n-    Nothing wrong with the system prompt of the agent\n-    Calendar is Integrated and has been given permission to access\n-    The time zone is America/Toronto and I’ve indicated this in the system prompt of the agent as well as in the description of the tools\n-    I am not using any other platform like n8n, only Vapi for now\n\n**Call ID** \nI tried many times, here is one of them: 019b6715-236e-7cc7-aeff-da0b36e0b58f\n\nFeel free to ask for more details to solve this issue\n\nThanks.",
