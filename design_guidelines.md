# Answer Overflow Design Guidelines

## Fonts

We use [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) for headings, and [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) for body text.

## Colors

Answer overflow uses a color palette of 5 colors. These colors are used throughout the site, and should be used in designs as well.

- Neutrals
  - ![#BLACKHEX](https://via.placeholder.com/15/F5F5F5/000000?text=+) `#BLACKHEX` - `<prefix>-ao-black` in tailwind classnames
- Accents (use sparingly)
  - ![#ACCENTHEX](https://via.placeholder.com/15/F5F5F5/000000?text=+) `#ACCENTHEX`

## Logos

The following logos are available for use in your designs.

- [SVG - make sure poppins font is available](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1069227604026073102/1073645187680710777/AnswerOverflowPOPPINSLOGO.svg)

## Accessibility

All designs must be accessible to everyone. This includes:

- Contrast ratios complying to at least WCAG 2.0 AA
- Suitable scale and spacing around text and elements

## Styles

We have a few set component styles that we use throughout the site. (Buttons, inputs, etc.)

You can view these styles in the [Answer Overflow Base Figma file](figmaurl).

## Ease of use

When designing, keep in mind that the user should be able to use the interface with ease. This includes:

- Clear and concise text
- Good contrasts
- Easy to recall and understand flows
- Responsiveness to different screen sizes
- Good use of whitespace and neutrals

### Recommendations

For quick mockups, [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) is a great tool. It's free, open source, and has a great community.

However, for higher fidelity designs and prototyping, [figma](https://www.figma.com/) is more suitable.
