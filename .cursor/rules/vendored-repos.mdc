We vendor the `Effect` repository as a git subtree under `.context/effect/`.

- **Patterns and APIs**: Look in `.context/effect/` for canonical patterns, implementations, and best practices to follow when building agents and related workflows.
- **Updating the subtree**:
  - `git fetch effect-upstream`
  - `git subtree pull --prefix=.context/effect effect-upstream main --squash`

## AnswerOverflow Production Codebase

We also include the AnswerOverflow production codebase as a git submodule under `.context/AnswerOverflow/`.

- **Context**: This is the current production codebase that we're rewriting. Use it as a reference for understanding existing functionality, business logic, and patterns that need to be preserved or improved in the rewrite.
- **Updating the submodule**:
  - `git submodule update --remote .context/AnswerOverflow`
  - Or navigate to `.context/AnswerOverflow` and pull changes: `cd .context/AnswerOverflow && git pull`

When I say 'the old answer overflow' i am referring to this codebase
