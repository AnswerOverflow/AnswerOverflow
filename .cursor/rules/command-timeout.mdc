Run commands with a timeout to prevent getting stuck. Use a timeout appropriate for the command:

- Default timeout: 60 seconds for most commands (install, build, test, etc.)
- Longer operations: Use 120-300 seconds for commands that are expected to take longer (e.g., full test suites, large builds)
- Quick operations: Use 30 seconds for simple commands (e.g., linting, type checking)

When running terminal commands, always specify a timeout that matches the expected duration of the operation. This prevents commands from hanging indefinitely and allows for better error handling and recovery.
