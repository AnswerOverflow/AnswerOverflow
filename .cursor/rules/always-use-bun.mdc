Always use `bun` instead of `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` for package management and script execution.

When running commands:
- Use `bun install` instead of `npm install`, `yarn install`, or `pnpm install`
- Use `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>`, `yarn <script>`, or `pnpm run <script>`
- Use `bun run <script>` for all package.json scripts (e.g., `bun run test`, `bun run build`) as bun reserves some commands like `build` and `test` for its own internal uses
- Use `bunx` instead of `npx` for executing packages
