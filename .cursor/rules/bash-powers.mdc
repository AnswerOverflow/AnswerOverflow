# Bash Powers

Use bash commands (`rg`, `fd`, `find`, `grep`, `sed`, `jq`, `git`, `xargs`) for bulk operations when faster/safer than manual edits.

**Guidelines:**
- Prefer non-destructive/reversible operations
- Get approval before destructive commands (`rm`, mass renames)
- Use for: bulk file ops, search/replace, git ops, data processing
- Show dry-runs when possible
