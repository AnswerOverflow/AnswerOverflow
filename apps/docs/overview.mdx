## Make your Discord support searchable

When someone solves a problem in your Discord server, that knowledge is trapped. Answer Overflow changes that by indexing your support channels and making them discoverable through Google.

| With Answer Overflow | Without Answer Overflow |
| --- | --- |
| Search Google → Find the answer from your server → Done | Search Google → Nothing useful → Find your Discord → Hope the invite works → Search the server → Maybe find something |

Your community already has the answers. Answer Overflow helps people find them.

To get started, check out [indexing](/channel-settings/indexing).

## Who uses Answer Overflow?

Answer Overflow works great for any public community focused on helping people:

- Open source projects
- Gaming communities and mod servers
- Game development communities
- Study groups and homework help
- Hobbyist communities
- Any community with active support channels
