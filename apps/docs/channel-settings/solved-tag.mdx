## Example

![Message with a solved tag that has a green checkmark](/images/sample-solved-tag-post.png)


## What it does

Applies a specified tag to a post when a user marks their question as solved.

## Why you might want it

This helps to organize content so when someone is going to answer a question, they can easily find questions that have not been answered yet.

## Enabling

Use `/channel-settings` in the channel you want to enable auto thread in. Click the **Help channel utilities** menu and then click on **Select a tag to use on mark as solved** and select the tag you want to use when a question is marked as solved.

## Disabling

Use `/channel-settings` in the channel you want to enable auto thread in. Click the **Help channel utilities** menu and then click **(Clear)** to clear the selected tag. Future posts will receive a âœ… reaction instead of a solved tag.
