## What it does

When users post in a forum channel with this enabled, they're automatically marked as consenting to [publicly display their messages](/user-settings/displaying-messages)—as long as they haven't already opted out.

This makes it easy to collect consent without requiring extra steps from users.

<Warning>
You must add a disclaimer to your forum guidelines. Example:

`Messages posted in this channel will be publicly displayed on Answer Overflow.`
