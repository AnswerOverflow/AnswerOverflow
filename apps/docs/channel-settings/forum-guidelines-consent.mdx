## What it does:

- When a user posts a message in a forum channel they will be marked as consenting to [publicly display their messages](/user-settings/displaying-messages) if:
  - They have not already set their consent state
  - They have not disabled indexing of their messages
  - They have not set their account to be ignored

<Warning>
  Make sure you add a disclaimer to your forum guidelines, here is an example:

	`Messages posted in this channel will be publicly displayed on Answer Overflow.`
