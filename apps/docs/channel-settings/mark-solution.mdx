## What it does

Lets users mark a message as the solution to their question. When someone marks a solution:

- The post gets a solved indicator (your configured tag or a ✅ emoji)
- The bot sends a message with a link to jump to the solution
- The solution message gets a ✅ reaction

- The original poster
- Anyone with Administrator, Manage Channels, Manage Threads, or Manage Guild permissions

## Why use it

- Helpers can quickly find unanswered questions
- Solutions get highlighted on Answer Overflow pages, making answers easy to find
