title: Indexing
description: Make your Discord channel content discoverable on Google
---

Indexing puts your channel's content on the web where search engines like Google can find it. Without indexing, people have to already know your server exists and search within Discord to find answers.

## How it works

Answer Overflow checks indexed channels roughly every 6 hours. New channels are indexed from oldest to newest, which can take a few days to complete. After that, updates happen every 24 hours.

<Warning>
New channels start indexing from the beginning, so it may take a few days to catch up to recent messages.
</Warning>

## What happens when you disable indexing

<Callout type="warning">
Content stays on Answer Overflow for up to 7 days after disabling indexing. This prevents accidental data loss.

Google keeps its own cache, so content may remain in search results longer. If you need something removed urgently, [contact us](mailto:support@answeroverflow.com).

## FAQ

### My content is on Answer Overflow but not on Google

Answer Overflow submits your content to Google via sitemap, but Google decides what to actually index. To improve your chances:

- Follow the [recommended channel setup](/recommended-setup)
- Enable [read the rules consent](/server-settings/read-the-rules-consent) and [forum guidelines consent](/channel-settings/forum-guidelines-consent) to maximize indexable content
- Consider [Answer Overflow Pro](https://answeroverflow.com/pricing) to host content on your own domain instead of competing with other servers on answeroverflow.com
