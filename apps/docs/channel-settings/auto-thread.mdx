## Why auto thread is useful

It's extremely hard to index content in a regular text channel with no threads as it lacks an indication of where the conversation starts and ends. Auto Thread creates a thread for every message in a channel, making it easier to keep discussions on track. You may want to use this in a channel where you want a lighter weight version of a forum channel.


<Note>
	While Answer Overflow supports indexing threaded channels, we recommend using
	[forum
	channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6208479917079-Forum-Channels-FAQ)
	instead as they are better suited for indexing.
</Note>

## How it works:

- When a user posts a message, the bot will automatically create a thread for that message
- The thread name will be in the format of `[Nickname]-[Message Content...]` to a length of 50 characters for the title

## Recommendations:

To get the most out of this feature, we recommend:

- Set [slow mode](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016150952-Slowmode-Slllooowwwiiinng-down-your-channel) to at least 1 minute to prevent users from spamming threads
