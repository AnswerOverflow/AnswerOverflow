## What it does

Auto Thread creates a thread for every message posted in a channel. Thread titles follow the format `[Nickname]-[Message Content...]` (up to 50 characters).

This gives you a lightweight alternative to forum channels when you want threaded discussions without the full forum structure.

<Note>
While Answer Overflow supports auto-threaded channels, [forum channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6208479917079-Forum-Channels-FAQ) are better suited for indexing and are the recommended choice.
</Note>

## Why use it

Regular text channels are hard to index because there's no clear boundary between conversations. Auto Thread solves this by giving each discussion its own thread.

## Tips

Set [slow mode](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016150952-Slowmode-Slllooowwwiiinng-down-your-channel) to at least 1 minute to prevent thread spam.
