## What it is

Answer Overflow has a variety of ways to let users control how their messages are displayed on the web.

- ### Consider all messages public (default)

This is the default for new servers. All of the messages posted are considered public and users are able to opt out with the `/manage-account` slash command.

- ### Consider all messages private

    #### User has not consented

    Their messages will only be shown to visitors of [answeroverflow.com](https://answeroverflow.com) if they are in the same server as the user.

    #### User has consented

    The user has provided consent via one of many methods to publicly display their message. Their messages in indexed channels will be shown to all visitors of [answeroverflow.com](https://answeroverflow.com).

## Publicly display messages on Answer Overflow

Use the `/manage-account` slash command and click on the button that says **Publicly display my messages on Answer Overflow** to publicly display your messages on Answer Overflow. This helps people find answers to questions that you have asked/solved in the past.

Consent can also be provided via:
