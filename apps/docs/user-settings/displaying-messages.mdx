description: How user message visibility works on Answer Overflow
---

Users control whether their messages appear publicly on Answer Overflow. Here's how it works.

## Server modes

### Public by default

All messages are publicly visible. Users can opt out using `/manage-account`.

### Private by default

Messages are only shown to visitors who are in the same Discord server—unless the user has explicitly consented to public display.

## How to make your messages public

Use `/manage-account` and click **Publicly display my messages on Answer Overflow**.

Consent can also be granted automatically through:
- [Forum guidelines consent](/channel-settings/forum-guidelines-consent)
- [Membership screening consent](/server-settings/read-the-rules-consent)
