## What it does

When users accept your server's rules through [membership screening](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000466882-Rules-Screening-FAQ), they're automatically marked as consenting to [publicly display their messages](/user-settings/displaying-messages) on Answer Overflow.

<Warning>
Add this to your membership screening rules:

`Some channels on this server are indexed by Answer Overflow. By posting in these channels, you agree to have your messages publicly displayed on the web.`
</Warning>
