## Server setup

### Enable Community

Turn on [Community](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server) for your server. This unlocks forum channels, server descriptions, and membership screening—all of which improve indexing.

### Write a good description

Your [server description](https://www.howtogeek.com/739355/how-to-set-up-a-community-server-on-discord/) syncs automatically to your Answer Overflow community page. Make it count.

## Help channel setup

### Use forum channels

[Forum channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6208479917079-Forum-Channels-FAQ) are the best channel type for indexing. Each post is a self-contained thread, making it easy to identify where a question starts and ends.

### Set a default reaction

Use `⬆️` or similar as the default reaction. This lets people upvote questions they also have, helping answerers prioritize.

### Use tags

- **Create topic tags** — Organize questions by topic instead of spreading them across multiple text channels
- **Use emojis** — Makes scanning the forum faster
- **Require tags** — Keeps things organized and makes people think before posting

<Info>
If you only have a few tags, add a `misc` fallback tag.

### Add a Solved tag

Create a `✅ Solved` tag. Answer Overflow uses this to mark resolved questions and highlight solutions on indexed pages.
