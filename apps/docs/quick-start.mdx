This will walk you through the steps to enable indexing of a channel in your server

 #### 1. [Add the bot to your server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=958907348389339146&permissions=328565083201&scope=bot+applications.commands)


<Warning>
	Answer Overflow requires all the permissions it requests, if you disable them
	it may not work properly.
</Warning>

####  2. Enable indexing for a channel

Go to the channels tab of your [dashboard](https://app.answeroverflow.com/dashboard) and select the channel you want to enable indexing for.

After checking the indexing enabled checkbox, you should see content being indexed within 24 hours.

#### 3. Next steps

While your channel is now indexed, there's more you can do to boost the amount of content that will be indexed.
