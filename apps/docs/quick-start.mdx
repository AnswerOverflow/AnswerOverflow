This will walk you through the steps to enable indexing of a channel in your server

 #### 1. [Add the bot to your server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=958907348389339146&permissions=328565083201&scope=bot+applications.commands)


<Warning>
	Answer Overflow requires all the permissions it requests, if you disable them
	it may not work properly.
</Warning>

####  2. Use /channel-settings in a channel you want to enable indexing in

Click on the **Indexing settings** button to open the indexing settings menu.
For a full overview of what these options do, see the [Channel Settings](/channel-settings) page.

Click on the **Enable indexing** button to enable indexing in the channel.

**You're setup and ready to go! The content of this channel will now be indexed into web search engines like Google.**
