# The best way to setup your discord support server

{/* TODO: Add images to this whole page */}

## Recommended server configuration

### Community

Set your server type to [community](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server) so that you can have a server description and a banner image.

### Description

Answer Overflow syncs your [server description](https://www.howtogeek.com/739355/how-to-set-up-a-community-server-on-discord/) with your community page on Answer Overflow so you don't have to worry about keeping them in sync. Make sure to set a good description for your server so people know what it's about.
{/* TODO: In the future we can have a "live preview" of what their server card will look like here */}

## Recommended help channel configuration

Looking for some inspiration? Check out the following servers with great help channels:
- `#questions` - [GitPod](https://discord.gg/gitpod)
- `#questions` - [Apache TinkerPop](https://discord.gg/56PMgQB7X5)
- `#questions` - [Typescript](https://discord.gg/typescript)

### Channel Type

The best discord channel type to use is a [forum channel](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6208479917079-Forum-Channels-FAQ) as it requires questions to be answered in a thread. This helps significantly with indexing content as it's easy to tell where the question related content starts and ends.

### Default Reaction

Set the default reaction as a `⬆️` emoji (or something similar) so people can upvote questions that they also have. This allows people answering questions in your community to know what to priorities.

### Tags

Tags help to organize your forum channel, rather than having a bunch of text channels for different topics, you can create tags for each topic.

#### Create tags for your topics



#### Use emojis in your tags

#### Require tags when posting
