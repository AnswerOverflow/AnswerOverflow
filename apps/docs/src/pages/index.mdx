# Answer Overflow Quick Start

This will walk you through the steps to enable indexing of a channel in your server

### 1. Add the bot to your server

{/* TODO: Add inviting bot screenshot */}
- You can add it from [BOT_INVITE_LINK]
- It requires all the permissions it requests, if you disable them it may not work properly.

### 2. Use /channel-settings in a channel your want to enable indexing in

The channel settings menu looks like this:
{/* TODO: Add channel settings menu screenshot */}
Click on the **{OPEN_INDEXING_SETTINGS_MENU_LABEL}** button to open the indexing settings menu.
For a full overview of what these options do, see the [Channel Settings](/channel-settings) page.

{/* TODO: Show a screenshot of the indexing settings menu */}

Click on the **{ENABLE_INDEXING_LABEL}** button to enable indexing in the channel.

**You're setup and ready to go! The content of this channel will now be indexed into web search engines like Google.**

### 3. Next steps

While your channel is now indexed, there's more you can do to boost the amount of content that will be indexed.
