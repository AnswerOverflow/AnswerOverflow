# Answer Overflow Overview

## What does Answer Overflow do?

### Answer Overflow has two goals:

#### 1. Index the content of your community

Assuming that a question has been solved in your server and no where else on the internet, let's take a look at a user flow before and after Answer Overflow

| With Answer Overflow                                             | Without Answer Overflow                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Google the question                                           | 1. Google the question                                                                                                     |
| 2. Find the question indexed from your server in Google          | 2. No relevant results found                                                                                               |
| 3. Read the answer to the question                               | 3. Try to find a place to ask the question                                                                                 |
| 4. Join the server linked on the question for further discussion | 4. Find a Discord server and join it (if the invite link is still valid)                                                   |
|                                                                  | 5. Search in the server I just joined for the question using the small Discord search sidebar                              |
|                                                                  | 6. (Maybe) Find the question I'm looking for                                                                               |
|                                                                  | 7. If I don't find the question or don't search for it, I ask my question in the server, resulting in a duplicate question |

Answer Overflow allows for people to focus on building with your product rather than hunting down answers to questions that have already been answered.

**Your community is amazing and Answer Overflow is a way to share it with even more
people, allowing all of the work that people have put into providing support to be
even more valuable.**

#### 2. Improve the quality of support in your community

There's more than can be done than just indexing your content. Another goal of Answer Overflow is to reduce burnout of community members and give communities more tools to improve their support channels.

This is done in the following ways:

- [Being able to mark questions as solved](/channel-settings/mark-solution)
- Community analytics (coming soon):
  - **Understand what questions are asked the most to improve documentation**
  - Know which community members are the most helpful
  - Visualize trends in your community to understand health
  - See trends in answer page views to understand what questions are most important to your community
- **AI question answers trained off your community data (coming soon)**
- AI question improvement suggestions (coming soon)
- **Redirection to correct support channels (coming soon)**
- Linking to the GitHub sponsor of a person who solves a question (coming soon)

## Privacy and the Discord ToS

Answer Overflow is built to provide the best support to your community while also being compliant with the Discord ToS and respecting your community members' privacy.

For users to have their messages publicly displayed outside of Discord, they have to provide consent to do so. There's a number of ways that Answer Overflow does this in order to both allow for comfort with community members and also getting content indexed into the web. You can read more about this in the [displaying messages](/user-settings/displaying-messages) section.

By doing this, Answer Overflow is completely inline with the Discord terms of service and you can feel comfortable adding it to your community. As a bonus, we're open source so if you want, you can check out <NextraStyledLink text="source code" href={GITHUB_LINK}/>
