# Answer Overflow Overview

Answer Overflow is a Discord bot meant to **improve and index your Discord help channels into Google.** This is a brief overview of what Answer Overflow can do for your community and how it works.

## What does Answer Overflow do?

### Answer Overflow has two goals:

#### 1. Index the content of your community



Assuming that a question has been solved in your server and no where else on the internet, let's take a look at a user flow before and after Answer Overflow

{/* TODO: I'd love to make this section into some sort of visual image instead */}

Without Answer Overflow:
1. Google search for the question
2. No relevant results found
3. Try to find a place to ask my question
4. (Maybe) Find your Discord server and join it (if the invite link is still valid)
5. Search in the server I just joined for the question using the small Discord search sidebar
6. (Maybe) Find the question I'm looking for
7. If I don't find the question or don't search for it, I ask my question in the server, resulting in a duplicate question

With Answer Overflow:
1. Google search for the question
2. Find the question that was asked in your server on a Google indexed Answer Overflow page
3. Read the answer to my question
4. (Optional) If I have a follow-up question or it didn't quite fit my situation, I can ask my question in the server and I now know that the server exists


**Your community is amazing and Answer Overflow is a way to share it with even more people, allowing all of the work that people have put into providing support to be even more valuable.**

#### 2. Improve the quality of support in your community

There's more than can be done than just indexing your content. Another goal of Answer Overflow is to reduce burnout of community members and give communities more tools to improve their support channels.

This is done in the following ways:
- Being able to mark questions as solved
- Community analytics to:
  - **Understand what questions are asked the most to improve documentation**
  - Know which community members are the most helpful
  - Visualize trends in your community to understand health
  - See trends in answer page views to understand what questions are most important to your community
- **AI question answers trained off your community data (coming soon)**
- AI question improvement suggestions (coming soon)
- **Redirection to correct support channels (coming soon)**
- Linking to the GitHub sponsor of a person who solves a question (coming soon)

## Who is Answer Overflow for?

Answer Overflow is for publicly communities with a focus on support, such as:

- Game mod servers
- Game development communities
- Homework help communities
- Any other community that wants to improve their support channels

## What about privacy and the Discord TOS?

This section is super important and the tools that Answer Overflow has built out are done in a way to ensure providing the best support to your community while also being compliant with the Discord TOS and respecting your community members' privacy.

For users to have their messages publicly displayed outside of Discord, they have to provide consent to do so. There's a number of ways that Answer Overflow does this in order to both allow for comfort with community members and also getting content indexed into the web. You can read more about this in the [displaying messages](/user-settings/displaying-messages) section.

By doing this, Answer Overflow is completely inline with the Discord terms of service and you can feel comfortable adding it to your community. As a bonus, we're open source so if you want, you can check out <NextraStyledLink text="source code" href={GITHUB_LINK}/>
