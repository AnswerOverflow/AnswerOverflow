# Auto Thread

## Demo

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player/youtube';
import { ytVideoStyle } from '../../utils/styling';

<ReactPlayer
	url="https://youtu.be/3pGDHWke6Wg"
	controls
	muted
	loop
	style={ytVideoStyle}
/>

<TryLiveDemo />

## Why auto thread is useful

It's extremely hard to index content in a regular text channel with no threads it lacks an indication of where the conversation starts and ends. Auto thread creates a thread for every message in a channel, making it easier to keep discussions on track. You may want to use this in a channel where you want a lighter weight version of a forum channel.

	While Answer Overflow supports indexing threaded channels, we recommend using
	[forum
	channels](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6208479917079-Forum-Channels-FAQ)
	instead as they are better suited for indexing.

## How to enable

Use `/channel-settings` in the channel you want to enable auto thread in. Click the **{OPEN_HELP_CHANNEL_UTILITIES_LABEL}** menu and then click **{ENABLE_AUTO_THREAD_LABEL}**.

## How it works:

- When a user posts a message, the bot will automatically create a thread for that message
- The thread name will be in the format of `[Nickname]-[Message Content...]` to a length of 50 characters for the title

## Recommendations:

To get the most out of this feature, we recommend:

- Set [slow mode](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016150952-Slowmode-Slllooowwwiiinng-down-your-channel) to at least 1 minute to prevent users from spamming threads

## Disabling

Use `/channel-settings` in the channel you want to disable auto thread in. Click the **{OPEN_HELP_CHANNEL_UTILITIES_LABEL}** menu and then click **{DISABLE_AUTO_THREAD_LABEL}**.
