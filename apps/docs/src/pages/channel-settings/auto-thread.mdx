# Auto Thread

## Demo

<TryLiveDemo/>

{/* TODO: Add a video here */}



## How to enable

Use `/channel-settings` in the channel you want to enable auto thread in. Click the **{OPEN_HELP_CHANNEL_UTILITIES_LABEL}** menu and then click **{ENABLE_AUTO_THREAD_LABEL}**.

{/* TODO: Screenshot */}

## How it works:

- When a user posts a message, the bot will automatically create a thread for that message
- The thread name will be in the format of `[Nickname]-[Message Content...]` to a length of 50 characters for the title

## Recommendations:

To get the most out of this feature, we recommend:
- Set [slow mode](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016150952-Slowmode-Slllooowwwiiinng-down-your-channel) to at least 1 minute to prevent users from spamming threads


## Disabling

Use `/channel-settings` in the channel you want to disable auto thread in. Click the **{OPEN_HELP_CHANNEL_UTILITIES_LABEL}** menu and then click **{DISABLE_AUTO_THREAD_LABEL}**.
