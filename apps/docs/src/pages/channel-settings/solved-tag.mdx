# Send Mark Solution Instructions

## Example

import {TryLiveDemo} from "../../components/links"

{/* TODO: Screenshot of a forum post with a solved tag */}

<TryLiveDemo/>

import {OPEN_HELP_CHANNEL_UTILITIES_LABEL, SET_SOLVED_TAG_ID_PLACEHOLDER, CLEAR_TAG_LABEL} from "@answeroverflow/constants"

## What it does

Sends a message automatically to **all new threads / posts** in a channel instructing users how to mark their question as solved. For users who are new to the server, this is helpful to let them know how to mark their question as solved. For users who are experienced, this is helpful to remind them to mark their question as solved.

You need to create a solved tag in the discord channel settings first before doing this, read more about this in the [recommended setup](/recommended-setup) section.

## Enabling

Use `/channel-settings` in the channel you want to enable auto thread in. Click the **{OPEN_HELP_CHANNEL_UTILITIES_LABEL}** menu and then click on **{SET_SOLVED_TAG_ID_PLACEHOLDER}** and select the tag you want to use when a question is marked as solved.


## Disabling

Use `/channel-settings` in the channel you want to enable auto thread in. Click the **{OPEN_HELP_CHANNEL_UTILITIES_LABEL}** menu and then click **{CLEAR_TAG_LABEL}** to clear the selected tag. Future posts will receive a âœ… reaction instead of a solved tag.
