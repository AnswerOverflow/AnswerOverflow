![Message with a solved tag that has a green checkmark](/sample-solved-tag-post.png)

<TryLiveDemo />

import {
	OPEN_HELP_CHANNEL_UTILITIES_LABEL,
	SET_SOLVED_TAG_ID_PLACEHOLDER,
	CLEAR_TAG_LABEL,
} from '@answeroverflow/constants';

## What it does

Applies a specified tag to a post when a user marks their question as solved.

## Why you want it

This helps to organize content so when someone is going to answer a question, they can easily find questions that have not been answered yet.

## Enabling

Use `/channel-settings` in the channel you want to enable auto thread in. Click the **{OPEN_HELP_CHANNEL_UTILITIES_LABEL}** menu and then click on **{SET_SOLVED_TAG_ID_PLACEHOLDER}** and select the tag you want to use when a question is marked as solved.

## Disabling

Use `/channel-settings` in the channel you want to enable auto thread in. Click the **{OPEN_HELP_CHANNEL_UTILITIES_LABEL}** menu and then click **{CLEAR_TAG_LABEL}** to clear the selected tag. Future posts will receive a ✅ reaction instead of a solved tag.
