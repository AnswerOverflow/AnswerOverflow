# Mark Solution

## Demo

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player/youtube';
import { ytVideoStyle } from '../../utils/styling';
import { TryLiveDemo } from '../../components/links';

<ReactPlayer
	url="https://youtu.be/QggUf4YCTaA"
	controls
	muted
	loop
	style={ytVideoStyle}

	ENABLE_MARK_AS_SOLUTION_LABEL,
	DISABLE_MARK_AS_SOLUTION_LABEL,
	PERMISSIONS_ALLOWED_TO_MARK_AS_SOLVED,
} from '@answeroverflow/constants';

## What it does

Allows users to mark their forum post or thread as solved. The following people are able to mark a post as solved:

- The original poster
  {
  PERMISSIONS_ALLOWED_TO_MARK_AS_SOLVED.map((permission) => (
  <li>Anyone with the {permission} permission</li>
  )) }

When a post is marked as solved:

- A solved indicator is added to the post, either a specific tag if selected or a ✅ emoji
- The Answer Overflow bot sends a message to the thread with a message containing a jump to the solution link
- The message resolving the thread is reacted to with a ✅ emoji
