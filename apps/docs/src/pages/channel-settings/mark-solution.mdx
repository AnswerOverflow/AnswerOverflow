<Callout type="warning">
  Indexed content will persist on Answer Overflow for up to 7 days after disabling indexing. This is to prevent people from accidentally wiping out their indexed content.

  It will also persist in Google for an unknown amount of time after disabling indexing. This is because Google has its own indexing process that is not controlled by Answer Overflow.

  If you need content urgently removed, please contact us.
