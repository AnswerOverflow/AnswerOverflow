# Mark Solution

## Demo



import ReactPlayer from 'react-player/youtube'
import {ytVideoStyle} from "../../utils/styling"
import {TryLiveDemo} from "../../components/links"

{/* TODO: Video of someone marking a question as solved */}
<ReactPlayer url='https://youtu.be/3pGDHWke6Wg' controls muted loop style={ytVideoStyle}/>

<TryLiveDemo/>

import {OPEN_HELP_CHANNEL_UTILITIES_LABEL, ENABLE_MARK_AS_SOLUTION_LABEL, DISABLE_MARK_AS_SOLUTION_LABEL, PERMISSIONS_ALLOWED_TO_MARK_AS_SOLVED} from "@answeroverflow/constants"

## What it does

Allows users to mark their forum post or thread as solved. The following people are able to mark a post as solved:
- The original poster
{
  PERMISSIONS_ALLOWED_TO_MARK_AS_SOLVED.map((permission) => (
    <li>Anyone with the {permission} permission</li>
  ))
}

When a post is marked as solved:
- A solved indicator is added to the post, either a specific tag if selected or a âœ… emoji
- The Answer Overflow bot sends a message to the thread with a message containing a jump to the solution link

{/* TODO: IMAGE OF THE MARK AS SOLVED RESPONSE */}
