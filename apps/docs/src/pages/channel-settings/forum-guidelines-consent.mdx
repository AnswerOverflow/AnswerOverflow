## What it does:

- When a user posts a message in a forum channel they will be marked as consenting to [publicly display their messages](/user-settings/displaying-messages) if:
  - They have not already explicitly consented, or disabled consent
  - They have not disabled indexing of their messages
  - They have not set their account to be ignored

## Enabling

Use `/channel-settings` in the channel you want to enable in. Click the **{OPEN_INDEXING_SETTINGS_MENU_LABEL}** menu, followed by clicking **{ENABLE_FORUM_GUIDELINES_CONSENT_LABEL}**. You are only able to enable this in a forum channel, you can open these settings from any post in that channel.
