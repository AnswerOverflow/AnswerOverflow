# Answer Overflow Quick Start

This guide will take you through the process of enabling channel indexing in your server.

### 1. Invite the bot to your server

<div className="flex flex-row justify-left">
	<AddToServerButton />
</div>

<Callout>
	Answer Overflow requires all the permissions it requests, if you disable them
	it may not work properly.
</Callout>

### 2. Use /channel-settings in a channel you want to enable indexing in

Click on the **{OPEN_INDEXING_SETTINGS_MENU_LABEL}** button to open the indexing settings menu.
For a full overview of what these options do, see the [Channel Settings](/channel-settings) page.

Click on the **{ENABLE_CHANNEL_INDEXING_LABEL}** button to enable indexing in the channel.

**You're setup and ready to go! The content of this channel will now be indexed into web search engines, such as Google.**

<Callout type="error" emoji="❗">
	For messages to be displayed publicly, users must provide their consent 
	to have their messages publicly displayed. You can read more about this in
	the [displaying messages](/user-settings/displaying-messages) section.
</Callout>

### 3. Next steps

While your channel is now indexed, there is more you can do to boost the amount of content that will be indexed.

To do so:

- [Review the overview](/) to understand all the terminology and concepts of Answer Overflow
- [Follow the recommended setup guide](/recommended-setup) to make sure your help channels and server are setup properly
- [Enable forum guidelines consent](/channel-settings/forum-guidelines-consent) so that all users creating new forum posts are automatically marked as having given their consent to publicly display their messages 
- [Enable read the rules consent](/server-settings/read-the-rules-consent) to have all new server members automatically marked as consenting to publicly display their messages
