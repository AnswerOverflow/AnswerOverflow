# Answer Overflow Quick Start

This will walk you through the steps to enable indexing of a channel in your server

### 1. Add the bot to your server

<div className="flex flex-row justify-center">
	<AddToServerButton />
</div>

<Callout>
	Answer Overflow requires all the permissions it requests, if you disable them
	it may not work properly.
</Callout>

### 2. Use /channel-settings in a channel you want to enable indexing in

Click on the **{OPEN_INDEXING_SETTINGS_MENU_LABEL}** button to open the indexing settings menu.
For a full overview of what these options do, see the [Channel Settings](/channel-settings) page.

Click on the **{ENABLE_CHANNEL_INDEXING_LABEL}** button to enable indexing in the channel.

**You're setup and ready to go! The content of this channel will now be indexed into web search engines like Google.**

<Callout type="error" emoji="❗">
	Users have to be marked as consenting to publicly display their messages in
	order for their messages to be shown publicly. You can read more about this in
	the [displaying messages](/user-settings/displaying-messages) section.
</Callout>

### 3. Next steps

While your channel is now indexed, there's more you can do to boost the amount of content that will be indexed.
