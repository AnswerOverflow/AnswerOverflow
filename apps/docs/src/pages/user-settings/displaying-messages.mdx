## What it is

In order to comply with the Discord terms of service and respect user privacy, Answer Overflow requires users to provide consent to publicly display their messages. Due to this, a user can be in the following states:

- ### User has not consented (default)

**This is the default state for a user**. Their messages will only be shown to visitors of [answeroverflow.com](https://answeroverflow.com) if they are in the same server as the user.

- ### User has consented

The user has provided consent via one of many methods to publicly display their message. Their messages in indexed channels will be shown to all visitors of [answeroverflow.com](https://answeroverflow.com).

## Publicly display messages on Answer Overflow

Use the `/manage-account` slash command and click on the button that says **{CONSENT_BUTTON_LABEL}** to publicly display your messages on Answer Overflow. This helps people find answers to questions that you have asked/solved in the past.

Consent can also be provided via:

- [Forum guidelines](/channel-settings/forum-guidelines-consent)
- [Membership screening](/server-settings/read-the-rules-consent)

## Disable

Use the `/manage-account` slash command and click on the button that says **{REVOKE_CONSENT_LABEL}** to disable publicly displaying your messages on Answer Overflow. Your messages will now only be shown to visitors of [answeroverflow.com](https://answeroverflow.com) if they are in the same server as you.
