# Display message consent

import {
	CONSENT_BUTTON_LABEL,
	REVOKE_CONSENT_LABEL,
} from '@answeroverflow/constants';

## What it is

In order to comply with the Discord terms of service and respect user privacy, Answer Overflow requires users to provide consent to publicly display their messages. Due to this, a user can be in the following states:

- ### User has not consented (default)

**This is the default state for a user**. Their messages will only be shown to visitors of [answeroverflow.com](https://answeroverflow.com) if they are in the same server as the user.

#### These messages will be displayed as:

<br />
<Message
	message={{
		content:
			'This is a message that has not been publicly displayed on Answer Overflow.',
		id: '0',
		questionId: '0',
		channelId: '0',
		attachments: [],
		childThreadId: null,
		parentChannelId: null,
		serverId: '0',
		nonce: null,
		pinned: false,
		flags: 0,
		embeds: [],
		interactionId: null,
		author: {
			id: '0',
			name: 'John Doe',
			avatar: null,
		},
		public: false,
	}}
/>

- You can't actually sign in to see this message as it is just a demonstration of what a message looks like when a user has not consented to publicly display their messages.

- ### User has consented

The user has provided consent via one of many methods to publicly display their message. Their messages in indexed channels will be shown to all visitors of [answeroverflow.com](https://answeroverflow.com).

#### These messages will be displayed as:

<Message
	message={{
		content:
			'This is a message that has been publicly displayed on Answer Overflow.',
		channelId: '0',
		id: '0',
		questionId: '0',
		parentChannelId: '0',
		serverId: '0',
		childThreadId: null,
		nonce: null,
		pinned: false,
		flags: 0,
		embeds: [],
		attachments: [],
		interactionId: null,
		author: {
			id: '0',

	}}
