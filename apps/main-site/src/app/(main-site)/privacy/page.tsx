				<h2>Legal bases for processing</h2>
				<p>
					Hedgehog Software LLC. will collect data lawfully, fairly and in a
					transparent manner. We collect and process information about you only
					where we have legal bases for doing so.
				</p>
				<p>
					These legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them,
					meaning we collect and use your information only where:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						it&apos;s necessary for the performance of a contract to which you
						are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into
						such a contract (for example, when we provide a service you request
						from us);
					</li>
					<li>
						it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your
						data protection interests), such as for research and development, to
						market and promote our services, and to protect our legal rights and
						interests;
					</li>
					<li>
						you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose (for example,
						you might consent to us sending you our newsletter); or
					</li>
					<li>
						we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					When you consent to our use of information about you for a specific
					purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time (but this
					will not affect any processing that has already taken place).
				</p>
				<p>
					We don&apos;t keep personal information for longer than is necessary.
					While we retain this information, we will protect it within
					commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as
					unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. That
					said, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage
					is 100% secure and cannot guarantee absolute data security. If
					necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance
					with a legal obligation or in order to protect your vital interests or
					the vital interests of another natural person.
				</p>

				<h2>Collection and use of information</h2>
				<p>
					We may collect, hold, use and disclose information for the following
					purposes and personal information will not be further processed in a
					manner that is incompatible with these purposes:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>to provide you with our platform&apos;s core features;</li>
					<li>
						to enable you to access and use our website, associated applications
						and associated social media platforms;
					</li>
					<li>to contact and communicate with you;</li>
					<li>for internal record keeping and administrative purposes;</li>
					<li>
						to run competitions and/or offer additional benefits to you; and
					</li>
					<li>
						to comply with our legal obligations and resolve any disputes that
						we may have.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Disclosure of personal information to third parties</h2>
				<p>We may disclose personal information to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						third party service providers for the purpose of enabling them to
						provide their services, including (without limitation) IT service
						providers, data storage, hosting and server providers, analytics,
						error loggers, maintenance or problem-solving providers,
						professional advisors and payment systems operators;
					</li>
					<li>our employees, contractors and/or related entities; and</li>
					<li>
						courts, tribunals, regulatory authorities and law enforcement
						officers, as required by law, in connection with any actual or
						prospective legal proceedings, or in order to establish, exercise or
						defend our legal rights.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If the ownership or control of all or part of Hedgehog Software LLC or
					their assets change, we may transfer your information to the new
					owner.
				</p>

				<h2>International transfers of personal information</h2>
				<p>
					The personal information we collect is stored and processed in the
					United States, or where we or our partners, affiliates and third-party
					providers maintain facilities. By providing us with your personal
					information, you consent to the disclosure to these overseas third
					parties.
				</p>
				<p>
					We will ensure that any transfer of personal information from
					countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries outside the
					EEA will be protected by appropriate safeguards, for example by using
					standard data protection clauses approved by the European Commission,
					or the use of binding corporate rules or other legally accepted means.
				</p>
				<p>
					Where we transfer personal information from a non-EEA country to
					another country, you acknowledge that third parties in other
					jurisdictions may not be subject to similar data protection laws to
					the ones in our jurisdiction. There are risks if any such third party
					engages in any act or practice that would contravene the data privacy
					laws in our jurisdiction and this might mean that you will not be able
					to seek redress under our jurisdiction&apos;s privacy laws.
				</p>

				<h2>Your rights and controlling your personal information</h2>
