We've moved Answer Overflow over to the NextJS App Router as part of our focus on improving performance and SEO.

Already we're seeing improved Page Speed scores and better mobile performance as part of this move.

Along with these changes, we've reduced our bundle size by lazy loading imports and moving the dashboard to [it's own site](https://app.answeroverflow.com).

Curious about how we did it? Answer Overflow is open source so you can check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/answeroverflow/answeroverflow)
