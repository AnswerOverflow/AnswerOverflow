A common piece of feedback we've received is that for non-commercial communities, a pay per page view model does not work and we agree. In order to support both commercial and non-commercial communities, we are introducing a new public platform that is ad supported and offers unlimited page views to all communities.

In the future, we'll be introducing a revenue share to split ad revenue between Answer Overflow and community owners. We're really excited about this change as it lets more communities get their content indexed.
