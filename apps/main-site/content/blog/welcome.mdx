# Welcome to AnswerOverflow

AnswerOverflow helps your Discord community's knowledge become discoverable through search engines. When community members help each other in your Discord server, that knowledge is preserved and made searchable on Google.

## How It Works

1. **Connect your Discord server** - Add AnswerOverflow to your server and select which channels to index
2. **Knowledge is indexed** - Questions and answers from your help channels are automatically indexed
3. **Searchable on Google** - Your community's solutions become discoverable through search engines

## Why AnswerOverflow?

Many Discord communities have thousands of solved problems buried in their help channels. Without AnswerOverflow, this knowledge is only accessible to people already in your server. We make it accessible to everyone.

Get started by [adding AnswerOverflow to your server](/dashboard).
