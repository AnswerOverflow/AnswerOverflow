- there's probably a bug in our onUpdate implementation where null should be part of live data, depends how convex handles onUpdate when the first value is null


We can reduce a lot of complexity by using convex-helpers, things we should use from them:
- rate limiting
- https://www.convex.dev/components/workpool may be relevant
- https://www.convex.dev/components/aggregate use aggregate

Extra work to be done after the migration is complete:

## Onboarding

Include a floating support widget / something similar w/ a quick add for Rhys on Discord

If the server has 10k+ members, 'VIP' onboarding

Flow is the following:
1. Sign in, have all servers listed to setup
2. On click setup open a page / modal with an add button for the bot
    - display the permissions it asks for & why it needs them
3. Put them on a pending screen while waiting for the bot to be added, pending screen should:
    - Have a link to go back
    - Have a button to readd the bot
    - Let them know we'll automatically detect being added
4. After being added, display a 'Thanks for adding, lets get it configured' screen
5. One click config that detects & applies recommended settings
    Recommended:
        - All messages public
        - All forum channels indexed
        - Send mark solution instructions
        - Apply solved tag
    Optional:
        - Anonymize messages
6. Advanced config that lets them customize


## Permissions

sync the bot permissions for that channel to channel preferences under the 'botPermissions' category
use this permisions value on the dashboard to show a 'red' 'yellow' 'green' on permissions if setup correctly
instructions on how to fix


## Draft mode

Communities should be able to turn on 'draft mode' that lets them see their server but not anyone else to make them more comfortable with getting context indexed

## MCP

- Global search
- Search a community (needs to pass an id, get from search communities), searches name + description
