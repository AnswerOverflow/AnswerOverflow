- there's probably a bug in our onUpdate implementation where null should be part of live data, depends how convex handles onUpdate when the first value is null






We can reduce a lot of complexity by using convex-helpers, things we should use from them:
- taking in extra arguments to customFunctions to pass the backend key (actually used for building queries)
- Relationship helpers
- rate limiting
- richer use query
- rls to enforce manage server permissions when updating server settings
- https://www.convex.dev/components/workpool may be relevant


organize as:
    publicInternal/
    authenticated/
    public/
    
each of those get their own query functions, keep the default ones banned



- we need to improve the way OTEL is done in convex/
