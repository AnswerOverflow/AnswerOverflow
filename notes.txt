- there's probably a bug in our onUpdate implementation where null should be part of live data, depends how convex handles onUpdate when the first value is null


We can reduce a lot of complexity by using convex-helpers, things we should use from them:
- rate limiting
- https://www.convex.dev/components/workpool may be relevant
- https://www.convex.dev/components/aggregate use aggregate


## Dashboard permissions
- We need to make a 'withPermissions' / 'guildManagerOrHigherQuery/Mutation/Action'
- This always takes in a server id
- checks if the user has the right permissions
- if not throws, otherwise good to go

Extra work to be done after the migration is complete:

## Onboarding

Include a floating support widget / something similar w/ a quick add for Rhys on Discord

If the server has 10k+ members, 'VIP' onboarding

Flow is the following:
1. Sign in, have all servers listed to setup
2. On click setup open a page / modal with an add button for the bot
    - display the permissions it asks for & why it needs them
3. Put them on a pending screen while waiting for the bot to be added, pending screen should:
    - Have a link to go back
    - Have a button to readd the bot
    - Let them know we'll automatically detect being added
4. After being added, display a 'Thanks for adding, lets get it configured' screen
5. One click config that detects & applies recommended settings
    Recommended:
        - All messages public
        - All forum channels indexed
        - Send mark solution instructions
        - Apply solved tag
    Optional:
        - Anonymize messages
6. Advanced config that lets them customize


## Draft mode

Communities should be able to turn on 'draft mode' that lets them see their server but not anyone else to make them more comfortable with getting context indexed

## MCP

- Global search
- Search a community (needs to pass an id, get from search communities), searches name + description





## Maybe:
Lean on convex-helpers/server/validators: literals and nullable would shorten enums/nullables in packages/database/convex/schema.ts (e.g. plan union, customDomain args), and typedV(schema)/doc would let you reuse table validators in args instead of re-spelling shapes across mutations.

Use getOneFromOrThrow/getManyVia from the relationship helpers to replace the repeated “withIndex().unique() + try/catch” patterns in packages/database/convex/authenticated/dashboard_mutations.ts and other helpers—reads clearer and centralizes the duplicate-detection error.

Extend your existing customQuery/customMutation wrappers with customCtx to inject common auth/permission context (e.g. authorizedUser from assertCanEditServer in dashboard_mutations.ts) so handlers can stay focused on business logic instead of re-running the same guards.

For the manual pagination/slicing helpers in packages/database/convex/shared/shared.ts (e.g. findMessagesByChannelId, findMessagesByAuthorId), swap the “collect then sort/slice” code for paginator/getPage on the relevant indexes; it trims boilerplate and reads closer to intent.

Consider filter when you currently .collect() and then run JS filters (same shared helpers file); it keeps filtering colocated with the query chain and avoids extra local post-processing code.
