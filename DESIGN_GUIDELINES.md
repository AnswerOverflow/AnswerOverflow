# Answer Overflow Design Guidelines
These guidelines briefly showcase how to design nice interfaces for Answer Overflow.

> **Note**
> We are currently undertaking a complete revamp of the answer overflow design. Colors, logos, guidelines, and other items are likely to be added, removed, and changed.

## Fonts

We use [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) for headings and [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) for body text.

## Colors

Answer overflow uses several predefined colors to ensure consistency. These colors are used throughout the site and should be used in designs as well.

- Neutrals
  - ![#070A0D](https://via.placeholder.com/15/070A0D/000000?text=+) `#070A0D` - `<prefix>-ao-black` in tailwind classnames
  - ![#FAFCFF](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FAFCFF/000000?text=+) `#FAFCFF` - `<prefix>-ao-white` in tailwind classnames
- Accents (use sparingly)
  - Soon.
- Others
  - ![#00FF85](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00FF85/000000?text=+) `#00FF85` - looks nice against the answer overflow black (with an opacity of 47% on lines) for indicating success to a user.

## Logos

The following logos are available for use in your designs.

- [SVG - make sure Poppins font is available](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1069227604026073102/1073645187680710777/AnswerOverflowPOPPINSLOGO.svg)

## Accessibility

All designs must be accessible to everyone. This includes:

- Contrast ratios complying with at least WCAG 2.0 AA
- Suitable scale and spacing around text and elements

## Styles

We have a few set component styles that we use throughout the site. (Buttons, inputs, etc.)

You can view these styles in the [Answer Overflow Base Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/GARsgsibWxOOzZ5MZ5XvWv/AnswerOverflow?node-id=0%3A1&t=BvruVK5YvFzx3bd4-1).

## Ease of use

When designing, keep in mind that the user should be able to use the interface with ease. This includes:

- Clear and concise text
- Good contrasts
- Easy to recall and understand flows
- Responsiveness to different screen sizes
- Good use of whitespace and neutrals

## Icons
We recommend using [hero icons](https://heroicons.com/) primarily for icons, and [boostrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) if you cannot find a suitable icon within hero icons.

### Recommendations

For quick mockups, [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) is a great tool. It's free, open-source, and has a great community.

However, for higher fidelity designs and prototyping, [figma](https://www.figma.com/) is more suitable.
