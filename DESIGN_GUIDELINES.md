# Answer Overflow Design Guidelines

These guidelines briefly showcase how to design nice interfaces for Answer Overflow.

> **Note**
> We are currently undertaking a complete revamp of the answer overflow design. Colors, logos, guidelines, and other items are likely to be added, removed, and changed.

## Fonts

We use [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) for headings and [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) for body text.

## Colors

Answer overflow uses several predefined colors to ensure consistency. These colors are used throughout the site and should be used in designs as well.

- Neutrals
  - ![#F5F8FF](https://via.placeholder.com/15/F5F8FF/000000?text=+) `#141619` - Answer Overflow Zircon - `<style>-ao-white` in tailwind
  - ![#141619](https://via.placeholder.com/15/141619/000000?text=+) `#141619` - Answer Overflow Charcoal - `<style>-ao-black` in tailwind
- Accents (use sparingly)
  - ![#396FF8](https://via.placeholder.com/15/396FF8/000000?text=+) `#396FF8` - Answer Overflow Ultramarine Blue - `<style>-ao-blue` in tailwind
- Others
  - ![#4BB543](https://via.placeholder.com/15/4BB543/000000?text=+) `#4BB543` - Answer Overflow Success Green - `<style>-ao-green` in tailwind
  - ![#DECB33](https://via.placeholder.com/15/DECB33/000000?text=+) `#DECB33` - Answer Overflow Caution - `<style>-ao-yellow` in tailwind
  - ![#DE3D33](https://via.placeholder.com/15/DE3D33/000000?text=+) `#DE3D33` - Answer Overflow Danger Red - `<style>-ao-red` in tailwind

### Color Systems

We recommend using the [HSB](https://www.learnui.design/blog/the-hsb-color-system-practicioners-primer.html) color system for colors. This is because it is easier to find a color that is similar to another color, as well as many other advantages!

## Logos

The following logos are available for use in your designs.

- [SVG - make sure Poppins font is available](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1069227604026073102/1073645187680710777/AnswerOverflowPOPPINSLOGO.svg)

## Accessibility

All designs must be accessible to everyone. This includes:

- Contrast ratios complying with at least [WCAG 2.0 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#contrast-minimum)
- Suitable scale and spacing around text and elements

## Styles

We have a few set component styles that we use throughout the site. (Buttons, inputs, etc.)

You can view these styles in the [Answer Overflow Base Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/GARsgsibWxOOzZ5MZ5XvWv/AnswerOverflow?node-id=0%3A1&t=BvruVK5YvFzx3bd4-1).

## Ease of use

When designing, keep in mind that the user should be able to use the interface with ease. This includes:

- Clear and concise text
- Good contrasts
- Easy to recall and understand flows
- Responsiveness to different screen sizes
- Good use of whitespace and neutrals

## Icons

We recommend using [hero icons](https://heroicons.com/) primarily for icons, and [boostrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) if you cannot find a suitable icon within hero icons.

### Recommendations

For quick mockups, [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) is a great tool. It's free, open-source, and has a great community.

However, for higher fidelity designs and prototyping, [figma](https://www.figma.com/) is more suitable.
